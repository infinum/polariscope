# Polariscope ðŸ”¬

Polariscope is a Ruby gem to evaluate the overall health of your Ruby application by analyzing its dependencies. It calculates a [health score](#health-score-formula) based on which dependencies are outdated and vulnerable to security issues.

Keeping dependencies up-to-date is crucial for maintaining application security, performance, and compatibility. This gem provides a quick and easy way to gauge the state of your project's dependencies and take measures to improve its health.

Think of it as a way to score outputs of `bundle outdated` and `bundle-audit check`.

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

    $ bundle add polariscope

or install standalone:

    $ gem install polariscope

## Usage

Polariscope can be used on the CLI and in code.

### CLI

Position yourself at the root of your Ruby application and run:

    $ [bundle exec] polariscope scan

The command will read the contents of `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock` and [`.bundler-audit.yml`](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-file) (optional, to ignore advisories) in the current directory and output the health score.

### In code

```ruby
health_score = Polariscope.scan
```

Without arguments, it will do the same as above. Optionally, you can override various parameters:

```ruby
Polariscope.scan(
  gemfile_content: '', # e.g. File.read('Gemfile')
  gemfile_lock_content: '', # e.g. File.read('Gemfile.lock')
  bundler_audit_config_content: '', # e.g. File.read('.bundler-audit.yml')
  spec_type: :latest, # see https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Gem/SpecFetcher.html#method-i-available_specs
  dependency_priorities: { ruby: 5.0, devise: 10.0 }, # hash of dependency priorities
  group_priorities: { default: 5.0, test: 2.0 }, # hash of bundler group priorities
  default_dependency_priority: 2.0,
  advisory_severity: 1.09, # number >= 1
  advisory_penalties: { medium: 2.0, critical: 5.0 }, # hash of advisory penalties by criticality
  fallback_advisory_penalty: 2.0, # used if value not found in previous hash
  major_version_penalty: 0.5, # number in range [0, 1]
  new_versions_severity: 1.09, # number >= 1
  segment_severities: [1.7, 1.15, 1.01], # ordered by segments: [major, minor, patch]
  fallback_segment_severity: 1.01, # in case dependency versions have more segments than in segment_severities
)
```

For details on what these parameters mean, consult [this section](#health-score-formula).

#### Additional features

Get the released or latest version of gems with:

```ruby
# released versions
gem_specs = Polariscope.gem_versions(['devise', 'pundit'])
gem_specs.versions_for('devise')
# => returns potentially many versions

# latest version
gem_specs = Polariscope.gem_versions(['devise', 'punt'], spec_type: :latest)
gem_specs.versions_for('pundit')
# => returns only the latest version
```

## Health Score Formula

The formula takes the contents of `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` and produces a decimal number in range $[0,100]$ representing the health score based on which dependencies (gems and Ruby) are outdated and vulnerable to known security issues. $100$ means everything is up-to-date and there are no security issues, and it lowers as newer versions are released or security issues are discovered.

By design, health score is most useful as a relative measure of application health: if your health score suddenly drops one day from 100 to 90, it signals a serious issue (e.g. a new vulnerability in your Ruby version). If it drops from 100 to 95, it may signal that a new minor version of Rails has been released, for example. If it drops from 100 to 99.5, it may mean a gem like Pundit has a new patch version with a bug fix.

How much the score changes depends on various factors:
- dependency priority (by default, [Ruby and Rails have a higher priority](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L6) than other dependencies)
- [bundler group](https://bundler.io/guides/groups.html) priority (by default, [`:default` and `:production` groups have a higher priority](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L7))
- number of new versions between the current and the latest version of a dependency
- the kind of outdatedness according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/); if there's a new major version, that will cause a sharper drop in the score than a new minor version
- the number of active security advisories
- [advisory severity](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) (e.g. a High severity advisory will cause a sharper drop in score than one that is Low)

### Formula

[This is the complete formula](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gemfile_health_score.rb#L22) (it's simpler than it may seem):
```math
\mathrm{HS} =
100
\cdot
\underbrace{\left(1-\frac{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d \cdot mp_d}{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d}\right)}_{\text{major versions score}}
\cdot
\underbrace{\left(\frac{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d \cdot {dhs}_d}{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d}\right)}_{\text{versions score}}
\cdot
\underbrace{\left(1 +\sum_{d \in G} \sum_{a \in d} p_a\right)^{-\ln{S_A}}}_{\text{advisories score}}
```

```math
\begin{array}{ll}
G & \text{Gemfile} \\
G_{dd} & \text{subset of Gemfile with direct dependencies only} \\
d & \text{dependency} \\
... & \text{see below for other symbols}
\end{array}
```

It's comprised of several scores in range $[0,1]$ multiplied together and then finally by $100$ to produce the health score in range $[0,100]$. Score formulas are described in the following sections.

Note that, by design, health score can never be higher than the lowest of its scores. For example, if your major versions score is $0.75$, then health score can never be higher than $75$, regardless of other scores being $1$.

### Major versions score

Score which signals how many dependencies have outdated major versions (it doesn't care about minor or patch versions). $1$ means no dependency has an outdated major, $0$ means all have an outdated major. All other combinations fall in between those extremes.

[The formula](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gemfile_health_score.rb#L30-L36) $1-\frac{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d \cdot mp_d}{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d}$ starts with score $1$ and is subtracted by the [weighted arithmetic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean) of major version penalties for all direct dependencies (only dependencies specified in the `Gemfile` and not dependencies of dependencies present in `Gemfile.lock`).

[Dependency priority (weight)](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L40-L44) $w_d$ is either a custom dependency priority, bundler group priority if dependency doesn't have a custom priority, or default priority if dependency's group doesn't have a defined priority (find default values [here](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L6-L8)).

[Major version penalty](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gem_health_score.rb#L21-L23) ${mp}_d$ equals $1$ ([by default](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L20)) when major of $d$ is outdated, otherwise $0$.

### Versions score

Score which represents how outdated direct dependencies are based on the number of new versions and the kind of outdatedness. Score $1$ means all dependencies are up-to-date. As dependencies get outdated, it starts to lower. Unlike major versions score, this score can never reach $0$, it only gravitates towards it.

[The formula](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gemfile_health_score.rb#L38-L40) $\frac{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d \cdot {dhs}_d}{\sum_{d \in G_{dd}}w_d}$ is a weighted arithmetic mean of dependency health scores. Same dependency priority $w_d$ is used as for major versions score.

[Dependency health score](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gem_health_score.rb#L15-L18) ${dhs}_d$ is calculated with the following formula:
```math
{dhs}_d=
\underbrace{(1+{sp}_d)^{-\ln{{ss}_d}}}_{\text{segment subscore}}
\cdot
\underbrace{(1+{vp}_d)^{-\ln{S_{V}}}}_{\text{versions subscore}}
```

#### Segment subscore

[Score](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gem_health_score.rb#L16) in range $(0,1]$ which represents how outdated is the **first** outdated segment (major, minor or patch) of a dependency.

[Segment penalty](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gem_health_score.rb#L43-L45) ${sp}_d$ is defined as the number of new versions for the first outdated segment. Take this example: your dependency is on `v1.0.0`, but `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0` and `v3.0.0` have been released in the meantime. The first outdated segment is major (minor is also outdated, but it comes after major, so it's not the first). ${sp}_d$ is then the number of new majors, in this case $2$.

[Segment severity](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gem_health_score.rb#L35-L37) ${ss}_d$ is a number selected based on the first outdated segment. Default list of severities can be found [here](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L22) (ordered major, minor, patch). For example, if major is outdated, first value is used.

#### Versions subscore

[Score](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/gem_health_score.rb#L17) in range $(0,1]$ which represents how many new versions have been released for the dependency since the current version. Penalty ${vp}_d$ is defined as the total number of versions between the current and the latest version (inclusive). Severity $S_{V}$ is a constant (find default value [here](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L21)).

(For more context on the function used for both subscores, see [this section](#penalty-and-severity-function).)

### Advisories score

Score which represents how many security advisories impact your dependencies. Unlike previous scores, this score takes into account all dependencies, direct or indirect (basically, everything in `Gemfile.lock`). Score $1$ means no dependency has an active advisory, and it starts gravitating towards $0$ when new advisories are found.

[The formula](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/advisories_health_score.rb#L12) $\left(1 +\sum_{d \in G} \sum_{a \in d} p_a\right)^{-\ln{S_A}}$ in essence sums advisory penalties $p_a$ for all advisories of all dependencies, adds $1$, and raises it to a power. See the next section for a detailed explanation.

[Advisory penalty](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L46-L48) $p_a$ is a number selected based on the criticality of the advisory ([default mapping](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L11-L17)). If criticality is unknown, fallback penalty is used ([default value](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L18)). Severity $S_A$ is a constant ([default value](https://github.com/infinum/polariscope/blob/master/lib/polariscope/scanner/calculation_context.rb#L10)).

### Penalty and severity function

Function used for several scores is of type $f(x)=(1+x)^{-S}$, where $S$ is some positive constant.$^*$

See this graph for various values $S$ (we'll focus on case $x\ge0$):
![graph plots f(x) for three values of S: 0.05, 0.17, 0.5](./docs/severity_function_graph.png)
and notice several interesting properties:
1. $f(0)=1$
2. $f(x+1) \lt f(x)$
3. $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)=0$
4. bigger $S$ -> more severe "drop"

Function returns values in range $(0,1]$ (properties 1, 2, 3). It starts from value $1$ (prop 1) which drops the further away we move (prop 2). Property 4 allows us to control how quickly the value drops with a higher $x$.

This can be used a simple but an okay way to model certain scores. For scoring purposes we will refer to $x$ as penalty and $S$ as severity. Take for example the [versions subscore](#versions-subscore), which uses this function: penalty is the number of new versions for a dependency, so the more new versions there are, the lower the score.

$^*$ In all formulas, severity is a natural logarithm $ln$ of some constant greater than $1$. This is purely because actual constants $S$ need to be small enough (smaller than $0.1$) to not cause too sharp a drop in the score too fast. It's easier to work with bigger numbers, so instead of $(1+x)^{-S}$ we work with $(1+x)^{-\ln(S)}$.
